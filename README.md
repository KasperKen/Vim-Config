# Vim-Config
My personal vimrc file. It's probably not the cleanest but it works for my purposes. Feel free to use it as you wish.

#Instructions

Linux Users - Download vimrc then rename it to .vimrc and place it in your home directory.
example /home/kenneth/.vimrc

Windows users - Download and place it in folder in your home directory named vimfiles. Then rename it to _vimrc.
examle C:\users\kenneth\vimfiles\_vimrc

in order to use the plugins make sure to install the vundle plugin located here - https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
then run remove any plugins from the vimrc that you don't want and issue the command :PluginInstall within vim

if you don't want to use vundle you'll have to remove the associated lines from the vimrc
